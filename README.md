# Research Paper Summarizer Project

## Overview
This repository contains the full implementation of a **Research Paper Summarizer System** generated from a meta-prompt in Copilot.  
The system takes a full academic paper as input and produces structured summaries following strict PS2 design rules, including hallucination checks, word limits, and modular validation logic.
