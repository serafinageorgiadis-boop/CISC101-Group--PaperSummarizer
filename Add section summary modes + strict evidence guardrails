This PR updates two modules:

1) Module 2 — Section Loop
- Introduces summary_level ("short" | "detailed")
- "short": 1–2 sentences and a ≤50-word table entry
- "detailed": paragraph + 3–5 bullets, plus a ≤50-word table entry
- Keeps PS2 table budgets (≤50 words per section; ≤200 words total)

2) Module 3 — Guardrails
- Adds evidence_mode = "strict" to enforce text-bounded claims only
- Standardized warnings:
  • missing/empty → "Section skipped: no usable text was provided."
  • short (<50 words) → "Section very short: summary may be incomplete."
- No invented citations or claims
